# Shulk Fix (Origins)

This datapack uses [PlayerDB](https://github.com/rx-modules/PlayerDB), and [`phi.modifyinv` MinecraftPhi module](https://github.com/MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules) to store the data per player via a global storage, and to drop the items from the storage.
<br>


### Note:
This only works for the Shulk Origin (for now), since we can't check for power types in the `cardinal_components` NBT, only the names of the powers.
<br>

If you have any suggestions, feel free to make an issue in this repository!
